I started making this program for my school because they didn't have a well made program for picking classes for the next semester. This program uses the schools Excel file containing all of the classes for the next semester to help the user find a schedule that works for them. The user would put in their list of classes they wanted in the next semester and the program creates every possible schedule based on class times on the excel file. Then the program is suppose to spit out the results in a well made Excel file for the user to evaluate. The final project would have the user put in preferences to the program like "Do you like morning or late classes?" or "Do you have sports at certain times?". The program would take this into effect, and create schedules with the preferences in mind. I've finished about 75% of the project. I've gotten the program to output to an excel file, but i haven't made it output in a way that looks like a schedule. I also haven't added the preferences yet, but that wouldn't take too long. This project uses Object-Oriented Programming, an outside library called JExcel.
